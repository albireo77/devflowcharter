**devFlowcharter** is a small application written in Delphi. Its main goal is to be straightforward, educational tool for use during structural programming classes.
In **devF** you create flowchart(s) using simple but powerful drawing engine, then generate source code ready to be compiled with external compiler. All these straight from devF. 
At the moment Pascal, C and TIBASIC are supported. Since language support in devF is in form of XML templates you can easily add support for other languages or even create your own.
