# devFlowcharter
devF is a freeware application for Windows. It's straightforward, educational tool for use during structural programming classes.  
In **devF** you create flowcharts using user friendly but powerful drawing engine, generate source code, compile with external compiler and finally execute. 
At the moment Pascal, C, TIBASIC, Java and Python are supported. Since language support in devF is in form of XML templates you can easily add support for other languages or even create your own.

## Compilation
To compile devFlowcharter you will need:
- Delphi 11.2 or newer
- SynEdit (https://github.com/SynEdit/SynEdit)
  To compile devF with SynEdit from their website, USE_CODEFOLDING conditional directive must be disabled in devF project setup.
  Archive ThirdPartyLibs/ThirdPartyLibs.zip contains customized SynEdit with code folding. It is preferred SynEdit package for devF.
- OmniXML (https://github.com/mremec/omnixml) but at the moment modified version from ThirdPartyLibs/ThirdPartyLibs.zip archive must be used.
