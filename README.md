**devFlowcharter** is a small application written in Delphi. Its main goal is to be straightforward, educational tool for use during structural programming classes.  
In **devF** you create flowcharts using user friendly but powerful drawing engine, generate source code, compile with external compiler and finally execute. All these straight from devF!  
At the moment Pascal, C, TIBASIC and Python are supported. Since language support in devF is in form of XML templates you can easily add support for other languages or even create your own.
